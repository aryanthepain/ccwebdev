This is my submission to the coding week web development module.

I have added some features that I would like you to notice.

In very particular order of favouritism, here I write the features that I added, making my project stand out from the others:-

1. The **date on top right** will always show today's date.
2. **API Loading.......**
3. The **high-level responsiveness** of the site.
4. The **gradient in the title is not an image**, so it will not pixelate/disorient/be unresponsive and will be a good boy.
5. The **hover, click and scroll features on the main 4 divisions**. The click features are only defined for touch screens.
6. The **ellipsis(...)** used are **not hardcoded** into the page, so they are also responsive.
7. The **hover effects on the navba**r and the **dropdown list on sports mode**.
8. The **hover effects** on the **side navbar**.
9. The **scroll feature **on the **sidebar**.
